#### rubric and criterion

 * Conclusions in data mining are predicated with the assumption that there are enough rows / samples to render the result statistically significant. "Enough" depends on the diversity and quantity of features and labels, but for the purposes of this course, I would encourage at least 100,000 rows. 
 * Objective is well-motivated and.
 * Modeling does not overfit the data.
 * Modeling accounts for class imbalance, and predictions aren't overly simplisitic (e.g., we shouldn't be predicting a single label 100% of the time.)
 * Preprocessing.
