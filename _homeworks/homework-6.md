Here are the starter kits that you might find useful.

* [Here are some mathematical properties](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zy2veJEjDT-0acPbGsrEC93EP0MOZIx54jL-gA7wPqE) that will help you in derivations.

* Document templates can be either [Overleaf TeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfwcfsbbgtxj) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/
document/d/1qXipr5Ko2Xpf71GbLzEZXa9khB5w4O2B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117230435864186314036&rtpof=true&sd=true). When you've compiled/finishe
d writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link. 

* To help you get started, you may find that this [Colaboratory Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dAqxrOEqrvlqhCJ2jwKX4UrDlNNACWC7?usp=sharing) is useful. In order to submit, you'll need to Download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.)


#### submission instructions

Commit your `*.py` or `*.ipynb` (either is fine as long as they are commented appropriately), `output.txt`, and `assignment2.pdf` to that 
repository and provide the URL via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/583114).
