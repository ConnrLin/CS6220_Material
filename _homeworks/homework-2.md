Here are the starter kits that you might find useful.

* Document templates can be either [Overleaf TeX File](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zfwcfsbbgtxj) or [DOCX File](https://docs.google.com/
document/d/1qXipr5Ko2Xpf71GbLzEZXa9khB5w4O2B/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117230435864186314036&rtpof=true&sd=true). When you've compiled/finishe
d writing, **download the PDF** from Overleaf/Google and upload it to the submission link. 

* To help you get started, you may find that this [Colaboratory Link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dAqxrOEqrvlqhCJ2jwKX4UrDlNNACWC7?usp=sharing) is useful. In order to submit, you'll need to Download the file as a `*.ipynb` file (Under **File** &rarr; **Download** &rarr; **Download .ipynb**.)

-----
#### submission instructions
-----

* Commit your `*.py` or `*.ipynb` (either is fine as long as they are commented appropriately), `output.txt`, and `assignment2.pdf` to that 
repository and provide the URL via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/494275) before 5pm, Tuesday, October 3.

* Make sure that you have documented your code with comments so that the TA can have an easier time understanding your logic. This will, in some cases, result in at least partial credit.

* Include a diagram of your pipeline description in your writeup.

* Include in your writeup the recommendations for the users with following user IDs: 924, 8941, 8942, 9019, 9020, 9021, 9022, 9990, 9992, 9993.

* We will be checking for plagiarism, comparing code that is too similar to classmate or past class alumni homework. This will automatically result in zero credit.

Each week, there will be a checkpoint for your project so that you are on track to turn in the project at the end of the semester. This week

* start thinking about what types of topics you're interested in researching. Write a three of them down and explain what interests you about them.
